Hello there! My name is Amat Gil (/amat/, /am'ad͡ʒil/), and you've stumbled into my GitHub profile! Feel free to look around and play, there's also a napping area included if that's more your jam.

I'm mostly interested in Rust (the language) and backend development at the moment, as my profile likely reflects; and I consider C/C++ to be deprecated.

More information and showcases and such over at [my personal website](https://amatgil.cat).

amatgil/amatgil is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
